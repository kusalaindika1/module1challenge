Wanted codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN  view the source code
THEN  find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
 


 # Html and css refactor

  reduce extra markup by adding css to the element directly.
